Repo for issue tracking of high-level work items of [fiboa](https://github.com/fiboa/) and [vecorel](https://github.com/vecorel/).

Most all the work for these takes place in the repos. We just want to track the highest level items for visibility in the overall Fields of The World [Phase 2 Project](https://github.com/orgs/fieldsoftheworld/projects/2)
